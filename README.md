# Create Your Own Image Classifier üñºÔ∏è

Welcome to my "Create Your Own Image Classifier" project, a project I completed as part of my studies in deep learning and transfer learning with Udacity. In this project, I built and trained an image classifier from scratch using a deep neural network. I‚Äôm thrilled to share this accomplishment with the community!

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to build an image classifier using a neural network model and fine-tuning techniques to achieve high accuracy. The goal was to create a model that could classify various types of images into categories, showcasing how custom classifiers can be developed with deep learning frameworks.

## Key Highlights ‚ú®

- **Objective**: Build, train, and evaluate a neural network that can classify images accurately.
- **Tools & Technologies**: Jupyter Notebook, Python, TensorFlow/Keras, and PyTorch.
- **Dataset**: Utilized a labeled dataset with multiple image classes for training and evaluation.
- **Model**: Designed and trained a custom neural network with transfer learning techniques to classify images effectively.

## Project Details

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Loaded and preprocessed images for the neural network.
   - Applied data augmentation to improve model generalization and reduce overfitting.
  
2. **Model Architecture**:
   - Built a neural network from scratch using PyTorch.
   - Fine-tuned pre-trained layers and adjusted parameters to optimize performance for specific image classes.
  
3. **Model Training & Evaluation**:
   - Split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets.
   - Used key performance metrics, such as accuracy and cross-entropy loss, to evaluate the model‚Äôs accuracy.
   - The model achieved an accuracy of **XX%** on the test set, validating its effectiveness in image classification.

## Results üèÜ

The final model successfully classified various images with high accuracy, underscoring the power of deep learning in building custom classifiers. The project serves as a great example of how neural networks and transfer learning can be applied to develop specialized classifiers.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrated the practical use of neural networks and transfer learning to create accurate and reliable image classifiers. Through this experience, I gained valuable insights into designing, training, and evaluating custom image classifiers from scratch.
